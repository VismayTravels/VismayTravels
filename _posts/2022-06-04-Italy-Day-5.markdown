# Day 5, June 4th

## 8:30PM

**It has been a couple of days since I’ve written in this journal.** Since Day 2, weather has been pretty rainy throughout the day, making it impossible to access the trails nearby. For the past couple of days I’ve just been researching Florence and hanging out at home, while also going to random food places nearby. I looked into getting another place further in the mountains to actually hike, but checked the weather to see rain all throughout the week. With that information, I went ahead and booked a train to Florence(€50), my hostel(€55 per night), and the tours/tickets I wanted to get. By getting “skip the line” tickets, you can essentially do just that. You don’t have to wait in the long lines of people, and you don’t have to waste that time either. 

**I left Bolzano at 7:12AM this morning on a direct train to Florence.** It was a nice, typical train experience. One thing I forgot to mention that I learned on the first day: always take bulky backpacks off before you get into a tight space like a bus or train. First, it lets you have more control so you’re not bonking people as you move down the aisle. If you have it in your hands, you can control and maneuver it out of passengers’ ways. Second, you don’t have to take it off in the tight space, where you’re likely to hit someone in the process. Also, if you know you’re traveling with a large pack, try to keep the things you want on the journey (earbuds, snacks, etc.) either accessible, or just on you before you stow your luggage. This way, you don’t have to rummage through your bag on a moving vehicle or in a tight area once you realize what you’re missing.

**Florence is well known for the gangs of thieves that cover the city, specifically in crowded places like train stations.** I was on guard the entire time once I got off the train, because the station was completely packed with people. There was rarely a moment inside where I was not in contact with another person. Almost at the exit, I decided I should exchange some currency and went to the nearby exchange. I was going to give her cash but she told me that is actually the most expensive exchange option, and card would be the best and cheapest option. I was surprised but happy to hear that, as I’d been subject to heavy fees exchanging at the airport for some petty cash. So something to note for my next trip: I don’t have to take loads of cash from home for money anymore, most developed countries will have the credit card capabilities to make the risk and extra cost unnecessary.

**I got to Florence at around 11:00AM, and went straight to my hostel to see if I could check into my room.** I was denied my room until 2PM as it was full, but was able to put my large pack in the locker and take my day backpack with some essentials with me, as I left to walk around the city. I got gelato (€2.50) at some random spot that happened to be genuinely the best that I’ve ever had. The strawberry tasted unbelievably fresh, with a slight tartness, and the coconut was perfectly creamy and sweet enough to balance it out.

**From here, I walked to the Boboli Gardens, an incredible landscaping marvel of over 100 acres.** It was designed for and made right next to the palace, Palazzo Pitti, of the Medici family. This house was immensely successful in banking and politics, and used that to indulge their appetites for art and glamor. One could say they funded some of the renaissance movement, by giving a place for geniuses like Botticelli, Da Vinci, and Michelangelo to study and refine their skill. Their art collections fill many museums worldwide, and are invaluable to modern day enthusiasts, even if they were just showpieces of wealth for old-time aristocrats. In the Uffizi gallery, which has the largest Renaissance exhibit in the world, we are able to see more of these indulgences, alongside commissions by churches that these artists and many others created. Even the Uffizi gallery, now a museum connected to another Medici palace, Palazzo Vecchio, was originally constructed to be the office of one of the Medici family members.

**One can truly see the remnants of this family all throughout Florence, solidifying themselves in history.** 
For dinner I ordered from a local Punjabi restaurant and ate in my room while researching next destinations. It was quite good for what I expected, so good for Florence. One thing I’ve noticed at this hostel that is completely different than other places: they don’t seem to have a working AC. If you know me even slightly, you probably know I prefer the warmth. But it is sweltering in this room for sure, and just laying on my bed has caused a light dampness on my arms. It’s not terrible though, and still better than a room that’s too cold, so I’m thankful for that. This hostel is a 2 bed room, and honestly feels like a hotel (minus the temperature control). Two nice full beds, an en-suite bathroom, and supplied towel and soap means this place is pretty fancy for a hostel, and I’m definitely thankful for it. I can’t imagine how much more uncomfortable it would be with 4 more people in the same room with no AC. My roommate is nice enough, and quiet so no other issues at all.

**Tomorrow, I have a tour of Da Vinci’s workshop and then no plans, so I’ll likely go to the Basilica of Santa Croce, where Michelangelo and Galileo are buried.** I’m also excited to eat more gelato, because the experience of a cold smooth cone of gelato during a hot Italy day is truly intoxicating. Maybe I’m being a little dramatic, but who cares? *Some things are worth being dramatic for*, I think.
