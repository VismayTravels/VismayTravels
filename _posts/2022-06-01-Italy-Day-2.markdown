**I am on the train to Bolzano, after transferring in Verona.** I woke up around 8 but was way too tired and slept in until 8:15, but don’t worry, I made my train just in time. Though it seemed a little daunting at first, the train system is quite simple and there are boards everywhere to tell me what track number my train will be on, and the estimated departure time. Packing was a little bit cumbersome this morning, so I want to go through and organize everything more efficiently so I have access to multi use items easily, while still keeping everything compact and organized as it should fit within the pack.

## 2:30 PM

**I arrived at the airbnb about an hour ago.** It was very close to the train station, only about a 10 minute walk. It’s a private room in the apartment of an Austrian/Italian woman, who is well-traveled and has visited India many times. From those trips, she has decorated her home beautifully with statues of Hindu gods, various paintings, and lots of lively plants. It was a very comforting and welcoming feeling seeing this throughout the home, especially as this is my first time doing a solo trip so far from my own home. 

**Speaking of this, earlier today I realized why I put so much importance and value in my wood bead bracelet.** When I was sitting on the train, I realized every single article of clothing I had in my body was brand new, and being worn for the first time. The bracelet was the only thing I have had for years, and has memories and experiences wrapped up in it. This may not be that meaningful of a concept, but it just hit me and I thought I would share. I guess one thing I learned is that I personally find comfort and peace in the things I’ve had and used for a long time, and so having something like that with me helps ground me no matter where I may be. 

**That’s not to say I am feeling homesick or apprehensive about my journey, as that is truly not the case.** I am very glad to finally be here and enjoy that feeling I have been chasing, of complete and true freedom of choice and time and decision. Even though I was never tied down back home, it feels liberating to have no schedules or deadlines or due dates,  do what I want with my time without worry.

## 9:00 PM

After relaxing, I decided to walk around for a little bit and perhaps grab lunch. After realizing the place I intended to eat at would be closed for another two hours, I grabbed some baked goods and a fruit drink at the nearby bakery for a quick and tasty meal. After finishing up, I walked towards the closest trailhead I could find, this being a cobblestone area where the houses stop abruptly and the true mountain begins.

It is a steep climb just up to the trailhead, and in that time going up, I realized I had forgotten my water bottle. Taking a moment to consider whether or not I should just keep hiking, I realized my mouth was uncomfortably dry and chose the wiser decision of heading back down. Luckily, the path back down to the airbnb was quick thanks to the slopes in my favor. Just I got back and refilled my water, a young guy came out of another room and introduced himself as the son of my host. It was very nice chatting with him, as he is young and knows the area pretty well. I’m looking forward to spending some more time with both of them, as it seems they have a lot of really interesting experiences. Once refilled and ready, I headed back up to the trailhead and hit the trail. This time, I made it up about halfway up the trail before hearing heavy thunder as the sky darkened. It became clear that heading home would be the smartest idea, even though I was finally in my stride and felt ready to climb. Nevertheless, for fear of the various items i had in my backpack and of getting sick, I turned back to be cautious. It ended up raining once I got home but much less than I expected, so once it stopped I went out to the originally planned restaurant, which my host recommended for their pizza. I must say it was incredibly good, and made me reevaluate what a good pizza really requires with the right ingredients.

Though the sauce wasn’t some stew of various vegetables and spices, and the cheese wasn’t multiple different random cheeses melted together, it came together for an incredible bite of creamy, tangy deliciousness. The crust was fantastic, the service was very friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was so warm and welcoming. I definitely will be going back at a later time, as I will be here until Saturday. It is very convenient that the restaurant is a literal 2 minute walk away from the airbnb, but after a meal, I needed a long walk exploring the city before being comfortable enough to sit or lie down. 

Overall, it was enjoyable exploring Bolzano on my first day, and I can’t wait to get further into the mountains tomorrow to get started on some more beautiful trails.
