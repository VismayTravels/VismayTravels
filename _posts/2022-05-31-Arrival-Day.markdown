**Welcome to the first travel journal entry of this trip.**

# Day 1, May 31st

## 12:19 PM

I landed at around 11 at MXP. One of my first surprises (besides some earlier ones regarding supplies, but nothing major), was that my airport is over 30 miles away from my hostel and Milan city center. This was the cheapest option by far, so it was still the best option. As I landed, I thought I looked to Uber as the first transport that came to mind, and saw it would be around €100. I was disappointed, but thought to myself I’d still come out ahead compared to other ticket prices. Thankfully my ignorance to other forms of travel was saved by big signs advertising €10 bus rides to the city. I think one of the main things I need to get comfortable with is figuring out transportation on the ground, talking to people rather than just trying to book a route online. I think I’m impeding myself from certain routes due to reliance on knowing my transportation, but that’s something I need to get over. The bus ride is about 1 hour to Milan Central Station, from where I will walk a couple of miles to my hostel for the night, Meininger Milano Lambrate. 

## 4:30 PM

The hostel is very nice. It feels like a hotel room, just adjusted for 6 people. I waited in the lobby for an hour, sipping on some fantastic pineapple juice that felt refreshing after a long journey. Once I got my room, I showered and went through all my items to just get some clarity. I have reservations for Joia, a vegan restaurant, at 8PM and so I will relax and read my guidebook until it is time to start heading out. 

## 8:10 PM

Joia is a very cool experience, with a unique experience for every one of the 12 courses. It was odd being so serviced in a restaurant, and the attention to detail was immaculate. They give you a specifically chosen utensil before each serving, also setting their servings spoons when necessary. They smoothly clear off crumbs and debris from dishes every few courses, so as to keep the area clean and clear. At one point, before I even realized I had dropped my napkin, I was presented with a new one on a wooden board and the floor napkin was swiftly taken away. Chef Pietro Leemann personally came by and asked about my enjoyment of the food. It was very cool to see the man and the mind behind the menu, as each dish had been carefully crafted by him to adhere to his vegetarian lifestyle, but also his culinary and artistic expertise. Overall, this was an incredible experience and I can’t wait for the next one. 

I took an Uber home from the restaurant rather than walking, like I did to get there. I was very full but it was late and apparently, the neighborhood my hostel is in is known as one of the toughest neighborhoods in Milan, so I thought it might be smarter to just get home safe and quick. Tomorrow I’ve got a train at 9:45AM to the Bolzano area. 
To the Dolomites!
